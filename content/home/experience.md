  * Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, aiming at rehabilitating stroke patients byusing cable-driven exoskeleton.
  * A 4-DOF cable-driven arm rehabilitation robot(CARR-4) and its controller were proposed, which consists of a 3-DOF shoulder module and a 1-DOF elbow module.
  * Kinematics and dynamics model was derived, a PD feedback combined with inverse dynamic feedforwardcontrol algorithm applied in trajectory control.
  * One conference article published.

  * Two robots were designed, one robot is powered by electricity called robot A, and another robot B without power and drivenby robot A,  robot A and robot B need to cooperate to finish a series of tasks in the given time.
  * Electrical fan installed on robot A to drive robot B, and developed an algorithm to adjust the wind force based onthe distance between the two robots measured by laser and ultrasonic sensors. 
  * Infrared sensor was applied on autonomicmobile robot A to make it move along the scheduled trajectory, infrared sensors were also mounted on robot B to detect andfollow the black line on the track.
